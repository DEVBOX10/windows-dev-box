This repository contains everything that I use to automate my Windows system setup. I had to re-install the OS on my developer box more than once, and every single time I had to set it up just right in an effort to make it work and behave the way I wanted it to. At some point I just decided to automate as much of that process as possible - this repository contains those pieces of automation.
